*Elixir* is a **clean**, **professional** Hugo theme designed to **captivate** your readers.

It's also **tiny** and **privacy conscious** with *no external dependencies*.  That's right---no JavaScript frameworks, icon packs, or Google fonts.  No ads or trackers polluting your console window (try it out and take a look).  **We kept things simple**.  A little vanilla JavaScript, a dash of CSS, and the power of Hugo.

All of the static assets for the site (JS files, CSS, and fonts) are located within the theme's */static/* directory.  **That way you know *exactly* what's going on your site**.

To get started, I recommend reading through the introductory post [here]({{< ref "/posts/2024-09-22-introducing-elixir/" >}}).
